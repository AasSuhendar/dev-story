Installation
------------
To install, simply clone the project to your local directory:

	git clone https://github.com/IntelDevZone/dev-story.git

Visit the [Intel® Developer Zone](http://software.intel.com/) and download and install the [Intel® XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools).

What's the story?
------------
Intel challenged a small team of developers to build an open source app. They created Dev Story/\*HACK THE CODE\*/, a set of mini-challenges about the development cycle of an app. But it’s not finished yet.

We’re bringing developers together from around the world to build something special and unique. So whether you’re honing your skills or flexing your coding muscles, you can modify and shape the open source code however you choose.

If your code makes the cut, you’ll see it in the next update. And you’ll take the credit.

[Read the full story at the Intel® Developer Zone](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android-devstory)

Who is this for?
------------
Anyone with experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project utilises:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - JavaScript framework
- [Panda.js](http://www.pandajs.net/) - Free html5 game engine
- [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) - 2D webGL renderer with canvas fallback

Usage
------------
Open the DevStory.xdk project file with the [Intel® XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools).

Enable developer mode in main.js
	
	App.developer = true;

Preview the app in the Intel® XDK Emulate tab or open up index.html in [Google Chrome Emulation Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode).

About the Intel® XDK
------------
[Intel® XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools) provides a simplified workflow to enable developers to easily design, debug, build, and deploy HTML5 web and hybrid apps across multiple app stores, and form factor devices.

- Make changes to the code using the built-in IDE in the Develop tab.
- Quickly preview the app in the Emulate tab.
- Run the app on a mobile device using the various build options under the Build tab.

###Dev Story – Hack the Code Contest 
###Description
Through this Contest, Intel is seeking innovative improvements for its Dev Story – Hack the Code App.(“application”). The
main aim for this campaign is to help developers to start out with html5 development and the usage of the Intel® XDK (html5
tool set). Additionally to tutorials and technical documentation on software.intel.com/Android, Intel wants to provide the
developer with the actual source code to learn and study directly from it.

The following is a brief summary of the structure of the Contest.

###1. How to Enter
To enter the Dev Story – Hack the Code Contest (“**contest**”) you will be required to:
- A. Register with GitHub at https://github.com/. GitHub* Terms of Service and Privacy Policy will apply to your
registration. A free account is sufficient for participation.
- B. Fork the code provided on the Intel Developer Zone GitHub (https://github.com/IntelDevZone). The code of the
application provided from Intel on the Intel Developer Zone GitHub Repository consists of different elements:
style.css, media files (audio and visuals in png format), Javascript libraries (jQuery, PIXI.js, Panda.js and
Modernizr) .
- C. Create an improvement to the application using the Intel XDK, which may be downloaded at no expense by
visiting: http://xdk-software.intel.com/ or any other tool that allows you to license the outcome of your work under
a BSD license, and submit your contribution to https://github.com/IntelDevZone. (“**contribution**”).There is no
limit to the number of contributions you can submit.

the level – this means new graphics based on the existing layout. The level names follow the career of a

character continues her/his development. For example this could be developing in the penthouse, boat,
yacht, privet jet etc.
    - b. additional mini-challenge inspired by one categories of the development lifecycle:
Concept, Design, Architecture, Coding, Testing, Debugging, Optimization, Refactoring, Alpha Release,
Beta Release, Golden Release, Monetization, Promotion, Patching, Support, Spending.
