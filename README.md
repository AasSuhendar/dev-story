------------
To install, simply clone the project to your local directory

What the story?
------------
Intel challenged a small team of developers to build an open source app. They created <span>Dev Story/\*HACK THE CODE\*/</span>, a set of mini-challenges about the development cycle of an app. But it’s not finished yet.

We’re bringing developers together from around the world to build something special and unique. So whether you’re honing your skills or flexing your coding muscles, you can modify and shape the open source code however you choose.

If your code makes the cut, you’ll see it in the next update. And you’ll take the credit.

Who is this for?
------------
Anyone with experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Usage
------------
Open the DevStory.xdk project file with the [Intel® XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools).

Enable developer mode in main.js
	
	App.developer = true;

Preview the app in the Intel® XDK Emulate tab or [Google Chrome Emulation Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode)

About the Intel® XDK
------------
[Intel® XDK](https://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools) provides a simplified workflow to enable developers to easily design, debug, build, and deploy HTML5 web and hybrid apps across multiple app stores, and form factor devices.

- Make changes to the code using the built-in IDE in the Develop tab.
- Quickly preview the app in the Emulate tab
